        <h2>Recipe for a Nice Burger</h2>
        <p>This is a burger recipe that I made through the help of my mother while I was
            initially making the burger.</p>
        <p>bro do this at your own risk I am not a chef I am just tryna make a website (Turned out
            good for me but I may not have specified perfectly.)
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Buns
            <li>Mayo
            <li>Ketchup
            <li>Red Chilly Powder
            <li>butter
            <li>garlic paste(or mashed garlic).
            <li>meat that can be shaped into a patty(ground beef, etc.).
            <li>other seasonings (bro I am not a master at telling the ingredients).
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get equipment like pan, grinder(if you didn't make the patty meat or bought it).
            <li>Heat the pan.
            <li>Put butter in the pan.
            <li>put garlic paste or mashed garlic into the pan and stir a bit until butter turns 
                slightly brown but dont burn the butter.
            <li>Once slightly brown, add the top and bottom buns one by one and move it around
                for ~10 seconds(you may need to add more butter or/and garlic).
            <li>Now the sauce, add mayo and ketchup in the ratio of 9:1 (9 being mayo and ketchup)
            <li>Add Red chilly powder to your liking.
            <li>mix
            <li>now the patty, add salt and seasonings to your liking to the meat you are using and
                 grind it 
                using a grinder.
            <li>fry it in oil(don't deepfry).
            <li>chop some onions and tomatoes
            <li>Now putting the things together, put sauce on bottom bun and put patty on it and 
                put more sauce on it. Then add cheese and the onions and tomato we chopped and Put
                top bun with more sauce. Finally microwave it enough for the cheese to melt.
        </ol>
